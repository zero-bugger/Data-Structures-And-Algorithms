# Data-Structures-And-Algorithms

I have started series consistings of Programming Questions depending of different DataStructures and Algorithms. 
Each DS will be divided into two part first is Basic and second will be Itermediate.
I will be using Java as a programming language for solving this questions.

Below is list of DS which will pe included in this repository
1) Arrays
2) Strings
3) Sets
4) Maps
